    <h2>1. Binary Gap</h2>
    <div class="flavor-text">
        <!-- <p>A <i>binary gap</i> within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is
            surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.</p>
        <p>For example, number 9 has binary representation <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">1001</tt> and contains a
            binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation <tt
                style="white-space:pre-wrap">1000010001</tt> and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one
            of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">10100</tt> and
            contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation <tt
                style="white-space:pre-wrap">1111</tt> and has no binary gaps. The number 32 has binary
            representation <tt style="white-space:pre-wrap">100000</tt> and has no binary gaps.</p>
        <p>Write a function:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block;"><tt>function
                    solution(N);</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should
            return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.</p>
        <p>For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation <tt
                style="white-space:pre-wrap">10000010001</tt> and so its longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N
            = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
        </p>
        <p>Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;">
                <li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">1</span>..<span
                        class="number">2,147,483,647</span>].</li>
            </ul>
